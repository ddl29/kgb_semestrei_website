    Here are some of my expectations for the web applications course:
    <h2 id="Eduardo">Eduardo</h2>
    I would like to perfect my experience in web development. I want to be able to create web applications that are easy to use and easy to understand. Also, I want to be able to create web applications that are web responsive and more complete plataforms.
    <h2 id="Erick">Erick</h2>
    Some time ago I made a small web page, it was functional, but I felt that it was missing many things, I hope to learn many things in this class to be able to create more complete web pages and at some point to improve the one I had already done.
    <h2 ide="Daniel">Daniel</h2>
    I want to build web pages using frameworks and become familiar with javascript. At the end of the semster I want to be able to build web pages easily for whatever project I might have, I would like to have that skill set.
    <h2 id="Adalberto">Adalberto</h2>
    I have really high expectations in this class since I haven't seen html or web since junir high and since I entered university it's something that interested me, especially how 3 different languages ​​interact with each other to create a web page.
